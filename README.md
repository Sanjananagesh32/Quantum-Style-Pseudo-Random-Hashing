# Quantum-Style-Pseudo-Random-Hashing
This project simulates quantum-inspired hashing by applying superposition, entanglement, and measurement-like transformations to classical hash outputs. Multiple parallel hash states are generated, merged using XOR, and collapsed into a final secure hash, offering enhanced randomness and complexity.
